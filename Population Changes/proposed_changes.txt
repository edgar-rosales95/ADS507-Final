True for all population data sets

- Drop the following...
  ['SUMLEV', 'PLACE', 'COUSUB', 'CONCIT', 'ESTIMATESBASE2010', 'POPESTIMATE2010']

  SUMLEV looks like some statistical code, not sure what PLACE is, COUSUB and CONCIT are all 0, and the 2010 population ones
  seem redundant since they're estimates, and there is already a feature for the actual 2010 Census

- FUNCSTAT and COUNTY

Don't drop FUNCSTAT yet since not sure what it is and could be useful, and COUNTY is the official county code, that could be useful
for connecting the other datasets to this one
