- What to do with missing values?

    - For the housing data, much of the missing data for the date columns is because data wasn't available in that city for those years.
      So still keep it?  Would need to make sure to allow NULL values for those SQL columns

    - Metro data also has a lot of missing, would it be possible to impute the proper metro?  Look at how Zillow defines Metro and 
      maybe from there we'll get an idea of why they're missing.  Doesn't make sense to delete those rows or columns so maybe just
      put none or make it the same as the county
    
- How to handle the dates in the housing data?  Most of the columns are M/DD/YYYY format.  They're also float now, so would need to be changed

- Rent data starts at 2015.  So cut off all other data to that date?  Or leave it?

- Actual County name in the wildfire data is FIPS_NAME, COUNTY is just a code
