**Notes so I don't forget**

Housing/Rental
    - Might need to reformat price data, not sure if it will do that automatically upon loading
    - Keep state name?
    - Rename any of the other columns?



Population
    - Rename the population columns?


Wildfire
    - Need to adjust State and/or Place code



Loading into SQL
    - How to write the code so this can be updated properly each month?


Places Table
    - Use state_id as primary key to connect the housing/rental/wildfire tables?
