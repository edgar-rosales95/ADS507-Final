Notes so I don't forget

- Check and make sure RegionID is unique and how it relates to the other values, I think that'll be the primary key for housing and rent
- Drop RegionName, RegionType, Metro
- Combine STATE, COUNTY and PLACE codes (STATE-COUNTY-PLACE) in population data as Primary key for population table
