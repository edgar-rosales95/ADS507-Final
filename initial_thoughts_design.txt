- I'm thinking 4 tables so far...one contains housing data, one for rental data, one for population estimates, another for the 
  wildfire data
  - For states, is it better to combine?  Or each state be it's own table?
  - I think we can drop all data for wildfire for at least prior to 2000

- For connecting state and housing data, the relevant columns are going to be (PLACE, COUNTY, NAME) and (State, Metro, CountyName),
  so connect one of those?  Or line up the COUNTY code and use that as the Primary/Foreign key?  It'll be the same with the Rent data

- For states, some of the columns we can drop are State and Stname since each CSV is dedicated to one state

- For housing data, State and StateName appear to be the same, so we can drop one of those

- State data, COUSUB and CONSIT are all 0's so can probs drop

- For states, PLACE is zip code

- Lot of columns can be dropped in the wildfire data.  

- Wildfire data has a feature DISCOVERY_DATE, dtype is int, maybe use that to connect other tables...though I think it would have to be 
  MM/YYYY format since the actual day could be any for wildfires while census data is yearly and housing data is end of month

- FOD or FPA ID in wildfire data uniquely identifies each fire...keep those as primary key and could aggreagate by county or place?

- Actual County name in the wildfire data is FIPS_NAME, COUNTY is just a code, but maybe use the code to match up with population?
