- I'm thinking 4 tables so far...one contains housing data, one for rental data, one for population estimates, another for the 
  wildfire data
  - For states, is it better to combine?  Or each state be it's own table?
  - I think we can drop all data for wildfire for at least prior to 2000
  - I think we combine the housing data (keep rental and housing separate) and add a code for top-tier and bottom-tier housing
  - Maybe split the housing data into two tables, rent_index and housing_prices, and then store the cities into one
      - And that means we can also have a Wildfire Table and Population Table.  So the city/state info can be the main
        table the rest are connected to
  - We can use FIPS code for state, county and place as Primary/Foreign keys

- For connecting state and housing data, the relevant columns are going to be (PLACE, COUNTY, NAME) and (State, Metro, CountyName),
  so connect one of those?  Or line up the COUNTY code and use that as the Primary/Foreign key?  It'll be the same with the Rent data

- For states, some of the columns we can drop are State and Stname since each CSV is dedicated to one state

- For housing data, State and StateName appear to be the same, so we can drop one of those

- State data, COUSUB and CONSIT are all 0's so can probs drop

- FOD or FPA ID in wildfire data uniquely identifies each fire...keep those as primary key and could aggreagate by county or place?

- Actual County name in the wildfire data is FIPS_NAME, COUNTY is just a code, but maybe use the code to match up with population?

- Kaggle api brings in the wildfire data, zillow is all public so we'll put the CSV's in the main file and provide the link
  in the README and same with population data

- We'll need to make sure when sending all this to a SQL database to allow NULL values since we'll have mmissing data for counties for certain years

- Add code in the main branch to handle missing COUNTY values?

- Any other data types we need to convert?

- In the wildfire data, the FIPS_CODE we can use because that's the official county codes, however we'll need to reformat it since they're
  incorrect in the data.  For example, the county codes for CA are 60.. however it's combinging the FIPS state and county codes, but CA is
  06.
